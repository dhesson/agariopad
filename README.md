# Project Overview
This project is an attempt to get gamepads to work while playing [agar.io].  Soon I will test and document Windows 7 support for the Xbox One controller.

# Supported Gamepads
- Xbox One (Wired)

# Supported Browsers
- Firefox

## To use with a Mac (OSX)
You'll definitely need Xbox controller drivers for your system.  Head over to this repo for the [controller driver] if you don't already have it.

# Setup Instructions
I'm currently working on Chrome support.  The code that is written should be cross browser, but the gamepad button press states are not reflecting properly.

#### Firefox
- Install [Greasemonkey] extension for FireFox.
- Copy the script from 
- Click Greasemonkey button -> Add New Script
- Click 'User Script From Clipboard'

#### Chrome
- Currently not supported
